# Railway Operation Simulator Package Manager

*Quick and easy add-on management for Railway Operation Simulator*

Railway Operation Simulator Package Manager (ROSPkgManager) is an interface providing a simple way of managing
simulations installed on your local copy of [Railway Operation Simulator](https://www.railwayoperationsimulator.com/).
Information defining the property of packages is taken from/stored in a metadata file.

The software allows you to:

- Install add-ons into your existing ROS installation.
- Create packages using available files.
- Remove these additions from the relevant application folders.

It is important to note ROS Package Manager follows the strict metadata file standard, and as such creation of a package
is only possible if ALL requirements are satisfied, i.e. simulation files, documentation and basic information
are provided.
