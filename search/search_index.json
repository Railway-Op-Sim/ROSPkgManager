GitHub Repository Install \u00b6 RailOSPkgManager supports the ability to install packages directly from a repository. For example you can install projects from the Railway Operation Simulator Developer GitHub ( ROSDGH ) by clicking the \"GitHub\" button after enabling advanced features. To install from a repository you must provide the name in the form <USER>/<REPOSITORY> , by default the USER is set to be the ROSDGH Railway-Op-Sim username. Optionally you may specify the branch to install from if this is not master . URL Download The URL https://github.com/<USER>/<PROJECT>/archive/refs/heads/<BRANCH>.zip is used to retrieve the project files. Error 22 If you perform above a certain number of download requests in a given time you are likely to receive an Error 22. This is from the GitHub server itself. This feature is for developer use only, all normal add-on installations should be performed from a zip file downloaded from the main Railway Operation Simulator website. Setting Railway Operation Simulator Location \u00b6 When the program is first launched you will be asked for the location of your local Railway Operation Simulator installation.

The built in editor form contains all the required fields for creating a metadata file to be included within the package. This file provides the means of linking together all the components of a package, as well as defines extra information such as version number. Those fields requiring one or more file path have buttons for browsing the local file system. Mandatory Requirements \u00b6 Requirements for package creation are quite strict, the idea being a package should be accessible to all using Raillway Operating Simulator where possible: Documentation MUST be provided and should be either a markdown file .md or a PDF .pdf , formats like .docx are not accepted due to them not being universal. You must provide only a single .rly file per package. Do NOT add a file to a package that is used by another simulation, this file will be removed whenever the package is uninstalled breaking any other simulations which require it. Image Inclusion In future releases image files will also be included as an additional field. Currently this is not supported. Editor Form Fields \u00b6 Field Description Package Name Name of the package as it would appear on a file system. Display Name Name of the package as it would appear on a listing.
